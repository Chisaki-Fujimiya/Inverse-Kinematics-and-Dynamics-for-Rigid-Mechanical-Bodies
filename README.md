# Inverse-Kinematics-and-Dynamics-for-Rigid-Mechanical-Bodies
Very rough introduction to IKD with jacobian-pseudoinverse using eigen/dense and cmsth libraries. This is an assurance that this file is merely a developing program aimed to achieve the aforementioned title at ease of both lines of code and practicality in terms of minimal error.
